# Next-Gen Devs: Collaboration Principles from Devs to Devs

This is a collection of collaboration principles, inspired from [Plugems: Next-Gen dApps](https://github.com/one-unicorn/theunicorn/blob/master/articles/Plugems-Next-Gen_dApps.md).

The principle is: act like the ideal software that you want to produce.

Therefore, these principles are meant to be extended by anyone who:
- develops open-source software
- holds common good collaboration above personal interests
- holds truth above personal limitations

## Rich and Strong Interactions Between Developers

Interactions are based on the common good. Developers agree on clear definitions of common values, visions, interfaces.

**Proofs of good intent:**

- Data that you have the option to keep for yourself, we want to see it shared, to be used by other dApps (than yours).
When you have new data to add to the data that was shared with you, share it with the same license and notify the originator.
- When you have an idea for a better standard or dApp than an existing one, first go to the developers of the original one and propose improvements, instead of creating a new dApp, just slightly different than the old one.
- When you develop new standards, do it transparently and invite other interested parties to contribute.
- Prefer to use and improve common good, open-source projects instead of for-profit or closed source/data projects.
- If you are a developer, contribute with your own proposal of best practices for collaboration and an upgraded moral standard. **You can start by opening issues [here](https://github.com/one-unicorn/theunicorn/issues) and we can collaborate on this best practices document for next-gen devs.**

**Let us learn how to program plugems by behaving like plugems among ourselves.**
